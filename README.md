### **_How to help_**

* Donations are always welcome.
* Work on the Gui module is urgent.
* Fullscreen effects (shadows, AO, Bloom...) would impress immediately.
* Networking has been requested to me by some people.
* AI / Pathfiding.
* Porting to Android, IOS and WebGl is a priority for some. 
* Vulkan and OpenGL 4.5 renderers would be nice in the future.
* Physically based rendering requires paid experts, so it will probably never gonna happen.
